# ResponsivePorfolio
A responsive portfolio about myself

For now a skeleton of self-intro website with repsonsive display effects.

This project allowed me to improve my css skills, such as making responsive effects to button actions or window scrolls.
Besides, I also grasped using thrid-party scripts & icons to make the website more fancy.
